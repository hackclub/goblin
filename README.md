## Build

‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è_Currently, there's a bug in goblin's dependency nlopes/slack caused by Slack releasing an API update
that contains a new `rich_text` field after their rich text editor rollout. Until the mainline of the
slack Go library fixes this, build goblin with_

```sh
go get -u github.com/nlopes/slack@d06c2a2b3249b44a9c5dee8485f5a87497beb9ea
```

_...to build with a version of nlopes/slack that works with the new rich text API._
‚ö†Ô∏è

Build with `go build cmd/goblin.go`.

Run with `./goblin`. Goblin should automatically connect to Slack and start handling messages!

### Add a command

To add a new command to Goblin:

1. Add a new file that'll define that command. Let's say you're adding a `goodbye` command to say
goodbye to Slack users. First, add `pkg/goblin/goodbye_command.go`.
2. In that file, define a command that conforms to the `gobline.Command` interface defined in
`pkg/goblin/command.go`. You can base your command on `help_command.go`, which is a pretty bare-bones command
that knows how to respond to a particular message and generate a response.
3. Add your command to the client in `pkg/goblin/client.go`. Add a new line where it says
`// Add new commands here` to create a new instance of your command.
4. Add a line or two about the command you just added in both `help_command.go` and `README.md` to help
users discover your new command.
